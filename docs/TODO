Better subtypes for structures:
    Inline single-value subrecords to make them more compact to declare.

Create common subgroups only once:
    Initially we should be doing this if the subgroup requested with an empty tag.

    Eventually we want to be able to derive common subgroups automatically by comparing
    all subrecords and groups with each other to detect duplicates.
        sort by signature:
            a subrecord matches if:
                each of its attributes matches
                each of its elements matches
                element and attribute order is the same


Resolve named types once all records and subrecords are declared, but before instantiation
of anything.
    How do we know when to do this?
    How do we lookup types that may not be in the same module?
