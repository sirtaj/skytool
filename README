Skytools WIP
============


EARLY GOAL
==========

The early goal is to create an easy pythonic object model for Skyrim ESP and
ESM files.  This includes transparent read, write and safe modification. The
model should also contain enough reflection capability to allow code to
generate views and transforms of the model through metadata alone.

Since the most complete machine-parseable specification of the file format is
currently the RecordStructure.xml file shipped with TESVsnip, I'm using this to
generate the python model heuristically.

Once the model is complete, the plan is to analyze the subrecord structure to
identify common patterns and groups of subrecords. This will be used to
generate a better inheritance structure for records and to identify hidden
abstract record classes.


INTERMEDIATE GOAL
=================

Use the object model to allow easy creation of one-off modding operations such
as merging, splitting, cleaning, and automatic generation of records like
leveled lists and actors. With enough support from the python object model,
this should be relatively straightforward.
